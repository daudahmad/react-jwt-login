# react-jwt-login coding challenge

Design a login page in which users retrieve a jwt token after successful authentication using React components

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This will also start an api at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) which will be used to authenticate login

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

On the login page you can use the following to log in:
```
Username: jack
Password: jack123
```

Clicking on 'Log In' will authenticate against the API and send back a JWT access token if successful.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
